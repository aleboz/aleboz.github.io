I am a tenured Assistant Professor with the Web Information Systems group, at the Delft University of Technology. I am Research Fellow at the AMS Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions, where I coordinate the research activities in the Data Science Enabling Technologies work line. I am faculty fellow with the IBM Benelux Center of Advanced Studies.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science, obtained at Politecnico di Milano with a thesis focused on model driven approaches for the design, development and automatic code generation of Search Based Applications.

My research lies at the intersection of human computation, user modeling, and web information retrieval. I study and build novel Social Data Science methods and tools. My goal is to help improving well-being and fostering inclusion by means of Web-based, personalized social computing systems that combine the cognitive and reasoning abilities of individuals and crowds, with the computational powers of machines, and the value of big amounts of heterogeneous data.

My work is driven by societal and business needs, and finds natural applications and valorization in a variety of contexts. I am principal investigator of the Social Glass project (Intelligent Cities); and principal investigator at the AMS Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions, working on data science enabling technologies. I currently hold a Faculty Fellow position at the IBM Benelux CAS, where I am principal investigator of the Inclusive Enterprise line of research (Enterprise Workforce Engagement).

Previously, I have been actively involved in the definition and execution of several Italian, Dutch, and European research projects addressing: urban data fusion, multi--platform, reactive, social-network based crowdsourcing; multi-domain Web search; human-enhanced audiovisual search; and other projects related to Web technologies, and Web architectures for embedded systems
