## Publications

I published more than 100 publications in peer-reviewed international journals (TWEB, IEEE Internet Computing, Semantic Web Journal, VLDB Journal) and conferences (WWW, UMAP, CSCW, Hypertext, ICWE, ISWC, SIGIR). I am co-author of the book “Web Information Retrieval” (Springer, 2013). I am co-inventor of the [US patent]() “Method and system of management of queries for crowd searching” (US 8825701 B2, 2015).

This page lists a selection of my most recent publication. The list is likely to be partial. For a complete list you can refer to my [DBLP]() profile, or to my [Google Scholar]() profile.
