    title: "Alessandro Bozzon"
    excerpt: "I am Associate Professor in _Crowd Computing_ with the [Department of Software Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/) of the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/) (EEMCS) of [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl). I am part of the [Web Information Systems group](http://wis.ewi.tudelft.nl)chaired by [Prof. Geert-Jan Houben](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/houben/). 
    <br/> I lead the _Urban Data Science_ group the [AMS Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions](https://www.ams-institute.org), where I am also Principal Investigator in Urban Data and Intelligence. 
    <br/>I am faculty fellow with the [IBM Benelux Center of Advanced Studies](http://www.research.ibm.com/university/cas/benelux/index.html). 
    <br/>I am part of the [Delft Data Science initiative](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/samenwerken/delft-data-science/), where I am actively involved in activities pertaining to the _Social Data Science_ work line. 
    <br/>I am an active member of the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus [BOLD (Big, Open and Linked Data) Cities initiative](http://www.centre-for-bold-cities.nl/home).
    <br/><br/> My research lies at the intersection of human computation, user modeling, and web information retrieval. I study and build novel _Crowd Computing_  methods and tools that combine the cognitive and reasoning abilities of individuals and crowds, with the computational powers of machines, and the value of big amounts of heterogeneous data.
    <br/><br/> I teach [_Web and Database Technologies_](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=48438) (BSc, with [Claudia Hauff](https://chauff.github.io)) and [_Crowd Computing_](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=45597) (MSc,  with [Nava Tintarev](http://navatintarev.com)). I regularly supervise students at at honours, Masters and PhD levels."
