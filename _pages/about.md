# Employment

I was awarded my PhD by Politecnico di Milano in April 2009, with a thesis focused on model driven approaches for the design, development and automatic code generation of Search Based Applications. During my doctoral studies, I have been a visiting researcher at the L3S Research Centre (Hannover, Germany, 2007), and at FAST Search & Transfer â€“ now Microsoft Development Centre Norway (Oslo, Norway, 2008).

I joined the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science of Delft University of Technology in 2013 as an Assistant Professor; I obtained my tenure in 2017, and I have been promoted Associate Professor in 2018. Since 2015, I serve in the EEMCS Computer Science and Embedded Systems Board of Examiners.

Since 2014, I hold a Faculty Fellow position with the IBM Benelux Centre of Advanced Studies, where I am Principal Investigator of Enterprise Crowd Computing.

Since 2016 I hold a Research Fellow position at the AMS Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions, where I lead the Urban Data Science Team.

Since August 2017 I am a member of the AMS Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions management team.
<!-- I have been appointed Principal Investigator of Urban Data and Intelligence in September 2018.-->


# Research Vision


My research lies at the intersection of human computation, user modeling, and web information retrieval. The long-term objective of my research program is to define the foundational theory for hybrid human and automatic data processing.

I study and build novel Crowd Computing  methods and tools that combine the cognitive and reasoning abilities of individuals and crowds, with the computational powers of machines, and the value of big amounts of heterogeneous data. My scientific work, which consistently resulted in high-quality publications, has always been supported by substantial implementation and demonstration efforts, with emphasis on impact and continuous interaction with stakeholders from both industry and the wider society.

# Publications

I have published 15 peer-reviewed articles in peer-reviewed international journals (VLDBJ, ACM TWEB, IEEE IC, IEEE Access, Semantic Web Journal),  75 conference papers in international conferences (WWW/TheWebConference, HCOMP, ESWC, ISWC, AAAI, IJCAI, CSCW, RecSys, Hypertext, WebScience, UMPA, ICWE), and several editorial contributions. The majority of my publications have been produced over the past 9 years. I am co-author of the book [_Web Information Retrieval_](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642393136) (Springer, 2013). I am co-inventor of the US patent [_Method and system of management of queries for crowd searching_](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8825701B2/en) (US 8825701 B2, 2015).

A complete list of my publications and more bibliometric informations are available in the [Publications](/research/publications) section of my website, in my [DBLP profile](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bozzon:Alessandro.html),  in my [Google Scholar profile](http://bit.ly/BozzonScholarProfile), or in my [Scopus](http://bit.ly/BozzonScopusProfile) profile.

# Funding

I have acquired more than 3.2M&euro; in research funding, specifically: 

-  &asymp;1M&euro; from European programs (H2020, EIT Digital, JPI)
-  &asymp;1M&euro; cash and in-kind contribution from industry (IBM, Cognizant, KPN, Telecom Italia)
-  &asymp;450K&euro; from Dutch funding bodies (NWA, 4TU)
-  &asymp;750K&euro; from institutional funding (AMS, TU Delft, EEMCS)
-  &asymp;15K&euro; for innovation in education activities. 

I received the [2017 IBM Faculty Award]() for my work on Enterprise Crowd Computing. I coordinate the Urban Data Science program of AMS, and the activities of the EEMCS Social Data Lab. 

The funding has been mainly used to hire research personnel.


# Research Community Service

I am member of the Steering Committee of the International Conference of Web Engineering (ICWE) conference series. 

I served as area chair for _Human Computation and Crowdsourcing_ at the WWW/TheWebConference 2018 conference, and as _Work in Progress and Demonstration_ chair at the _HCOMP2018_ conference. 

I have been Program Chair for the 16th International Conference of Web Engineering (ICWE 2016) and for the AWC 2015 (Australasian Web Conference) in Sydney. I have been program chair of 10 workshops (SMAC2017,CitRec2017,KDWeb 2017/2016/2015, CrowdUI2014, SoHuman2014, OrdRing 2011, DataView2011 and 2010) 

I served as track chair and senior PC member for several conferences (ICWE, UMAP, HCOMP), and as PC member of several top-tier conferences (WWW/TheWebConference, WSDM, WebSci, SIGKDD, AAAI, IJCAI, ACM MM, ICWE, ESWC, ISWC, CSCW, CHI). 


I served as co-editor for a special issue of the Semantic Web Journal on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing. I provide review service for several top-tier international journals and transactions (e.g. TWEB, Internet Computing, VLDBJ, TOSEM, TIST, TiiS, SIGMOD Record, JWE).
