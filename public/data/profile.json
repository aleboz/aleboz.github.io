  "bioLong": "I am a Professor of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), and Head of the Department of Sustainable Design Engineering since November 2020. I am a Fellow of the Netherlands Academy of Engineering, chair of the Delft AI Labs and Talents initiative, and co-director of the Future Libraries Lab (with the Royal Library of The Netherlands).\n\nMy research focuses on methods and tools that support the design, development, and deployment of AI-powered systems that are human-centered, inclusive, and responsible. I combine expertise in Human-Computer Interaction, human computation, user modelling, and machine learning to study Crowd Computing and Human-Centered AI.\n\nI have published 200+ peer-reviewed papers in top venues such as ACM CHI, CSCW, TheWebConf, AAAI, IUI, VLDB, and SIGIR. My work has received multiple best paper awards and has been funded by NWO, EU Horizon, and industry partners.",
